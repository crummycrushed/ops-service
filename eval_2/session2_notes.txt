1. Seeing RAGAS in action : python based evaluation frameworks
2. Create a dataset
3. Interface to talk to ollama [cmdline]
4. Inject that dataset to generate response from ollama 
5. Run evaluation using ragas interface to predice bleu and rogue score
6. Save the result into a csv
7. Add interface on gpt


SingleTurnSample :
   1 - 1 mapping. ( 1model response to 1 prmplt)

   sample = SingleTurnSample(
    respnse = "The eifferl tower is in India"
    referece = "The eiffel towen is in paris"
   )
MultiTurnSample:
    Represent a conversation with multiple turns 

    sample = MultiTurnSample(
        turn=[

            {
                "user_input": "Where is the eiffel tower",
                "response": "It is in India",
                "reference" "It is in Paris"

            },
            {
                "user_input": "When was it built?",
                "response": "In 1990",
                "reference" "IN 1889"
            }
        ]
    )



    EvaluationDataset : Represent a collection of sample
